Thank you for purchasing Dynamic Navigation!


It is strongly suggested that you visit the tutorials and help page before attempting to use this system.

For those of you who are using Fantasy AI, the download links to get you started are located on the help page as well!

Note: The reason why the scripts for Fantasy AI could not be included, is because they would be calling on scripts
that do not exist, you must have Fantasy AI merged with Dynamic Navigation or you will get errors.
